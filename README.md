# VMUGhub
An idea to discuss for 2018

We always speak about the importance of building a community first, and then letting *that* power the VMUG. The idea is that if people make valuable relationships with other users, they will come to VMUGs regardless of what the event is - because primarily they know they will be able to see their friends and connect in an enjoyable atmosphere.

So far things like whiteboard meetings and little hacks, vBeers and dinners like #vRamen and #vCurry (yes, you should be on twitter) are great for fostering relationships and making people get to know each other. But how are we taking that to a next level and helping each other?

Wouldn't it be great if your local VMUG was also a reliable connection hub for those looking for mentors, for certification test study groups, and job postings?

Wait, isn't that already something VMUG does? Well yes, but here's the thing - it's very informal and not standardized. VMUG leaders get to meet a lot of people and are always willing to help, but they are humans with jobs too, so relying on a few minutes during a conference or twitter interactions leads to inefficiencies.

What could be done is each VMUG have a registry of 

1) people who offer to mentor (small bio, contact method listed)
2) ‎people who are willing to study with others in preparing for a cert
3) ‎people who have certs and are willing to help others prepare (the right way, of course)

And all you need to do is use the vmug website to login and see this information. This could probably be done today using the forum and post feature which is already there, it's just communicating the idea and having it spread across the worldwide VMUGs.

And what could be done to encourage people to actually look at this and participate? Well we had many ideas. This is where it gets tricky, because good will only gets you so far.

First, you will have the people who will participate with no further convincing - lots in the vCommunity have realized the vakue in helping others. I'm counting in this crowd vExperts and VMUG "loyals", plus anyone who was actively looking for help.

Second, since we still have lots of people who only get VMUG news through e-mail or during a session (and haven't discovered twitter), we have to create a marketing campaign. Make a hashtag, create instructions for VMUG leaders and users on how to do this in vmug.com, and communicate to leaders and users. The crowd in #1 will also help spread the message.

Third, catering to the crowd who has been around VMware/IT a while, has VCPs or more, and don't go to VMUG meetings because their job has taken on more responsibility/travel, work for a vendor, or changed focus. We think they are still great, local, resources who can help in other ways than attending VMUGs - they may still want to mentor or coach if it can be accommodated to their schedules. To contact them, it would be cool for VMUG leaders to be able to request VMware edu for a list of their local certified peeps, and have the leaders reach out. To make this "cold contact" more amenable, there could be an incentive. For example, VCPs need to re-certify, so we could make it where current certified peeps get a discount code sent by mail to their local VMUG leaders, creating an incentive for leaders to meet with everyone who is VMware certified in their city.

Standardizing this validates VNUG as a local hub for career growth and ankes it easy for people to find each other. Creating that first link leads to a coffee here or there, study groups being formed, and people paying it forward. It will take a while to really quantify the benefits, but slowly but surely this will increase the vakue of vCommunity involvement and each time something good comes out of this initiative it can highlighted at the local meetings.
