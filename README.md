# VMUGhub
An idea to discuss for 2018 - open for collaboration to all the vCommunity

_Originally idea from  <a href="https://twitter.com/wildcard78" target="_blank"> @wildcard78</a>, moved to Github so we can expand and ask for more comments_

We always speak about the importance of building a community first, and then letting *that* power the VMUG. The idea is that if attendees make valuable relationships with other attendees, they will come to VMUGs regardless of what the event is - because primarily they know they will be able to see their friends and connect in an enjoyable atmosphere.

So far things like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23VMUGWB" target="_blank"> Whiteboard Mmeetings</a>  and <a href="https://vbrownbag.com/2017/09/in-support-of-vmworldhackathon-vmwarecode-and-carlcapozza-pghlittlehack/" target="_blank"> Little Hackathons</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23vBeers" target="_blank"> vBeers</a> and food-centric meetups like <a href="http://www.vbrisket.com/" target="_blank"> #vBrisket</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23vRamen" target="_blank"> #vRamen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23vCurry" target="_blank"> #vCurry</a> are great for fostering relationships and making people get to know each other. But how are we taking that to a next level and really helping each other?

_(Yes, you should use your Twitter account to participate in the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23vCommunity" target="_blank"> #vCommunity</a>)_

Wouldn't it be great if your local VMUG was also a reliable connection hub for those looking for mentors, for certification test study groups, and job postings?

Wait, isn't that already something VMUG does? Well yes, but here's the thing - it's very informal and not standardized across all chapters. VMUG leaders, as a by-product of their role, get to meet a lot of people and are always willing to go the extra-mile and help, but they are humans with jobs too; relying on already busy people to meaningfully coordinate, with only a few minutes notice and during a meeting, is probably asking too much, and people who are asking for help hate being a bother.

What could be done is each VMUG have a "registry" of 

a) people who offer to mentor (small bio, contact method listed)  
b) people who are willing to study with others in preparing for a cert  
c) people who already have certs and are willing to help others prepare (the right way, no breaking of test rules)

This can be possibly achieved with each vmug's website so people have to login and join the VMUG group in order to see this information. It can probably be done today using the forum feature as pinned posts which I think is already there, so it would only be a matter of communicating the idea and having it spread across the worldwide VMUGs.

Let's say that's how we build it. How would they come? What could be done to encourage people to actually look at this and participate? Well we had many ideas. This is where it gets tricky, because good will only gets you so far :) Here's some things we discussed:

1) You will have the people who are glad to participate without further convincing - lots in the vCommunity have realized the value in helping others. I'm counting in this crowd vExperts and VMUG "loyals", plus anyone who was already actively looking for help.

2) Since we still have lots of people who only get VMUG news through e-mail or during a session (and haven't discovered twitter), we have to create a marketing campaign. Make a hashtag, create instructions for VMUG leaders and users on how to do this in vmug.com, and communicate to leaders and users. The crowd in #1 will also help spread the message.

3) Catering to the crowd who has been around VMware/IT a while, already has a VCP or more, and don't typically go to VMUG meetings anymore because their job has taken on more responsibility, travel, they now work for a vendor, or they have changed focus. We think they are still great, local, resources who can help in other ways than just attending VMUGs - they may still want to mentor or coach if it can be accommodated to their schedules. To contact them, it would be cool for VMUG leaders to be able to request VMware edu for a list of their local certified peeps, and have the leaders reach out. To make this "cold contact" more amenable, there could be an incentive. For example, VCPs need to re-certify, so we could make it where current certified peeps get a discount code sent by mail to their local VMUG leaders, creating an incentive for leaders to physically meet with everyone who is VMware certified in their city.

Standardizing this effort validates the local VMUG chapters as an excellent hub/community for infrastructure IT career growth, and makes it easy for people to find help in advancing their careers. Creating that first contact opportunity leads to chat, coffee meetups, study groups being formed, and the most important: people paying it forward by helping others in their community. It will take a while to really quantify the benefits, but slowly but surely this will increase the value of VMUG involvement and each time something good comes out of this initiative it can highlighted at the local meetings.
